# AWS SimuLearn Cloud Practitioner

[visit](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-simulearn/)

## Overview

In this AWS SimuLearn assignment, you review a real-world scenario, helping a fictional customer design a solution on AWS.

After the design is completed, you build the proposed solution in a guided lab within a live AWS Management Console environment.

You gain hands-on experience working with AWS services, using the same tools technology professionals use to construct AWS solutions.

## How it works

AWS SimuLearn is powered by generative AI to help develop your soft skills, such as communication and problem-solving, in life-like conversations with AI-generated customers. An AI quiz agent evaluates your conversation responses, and an AI helper agent, Dr. Newton, is available when you get stuck.

After each solution-building conversation, you build and validate the solution in a live AWS Console environment.
