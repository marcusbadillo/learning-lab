## Introducing Generative AI with AWS

This course offers an in-depth exploration of generative artificial intelligence (AI), emphasizing its foundational concepts and real-world applications. We'll cover foundational concepts in machine learning and generative AI and hands-on practice will connect your technical knowledge to thinking about the responsible and inclusive use of AI.

### Topics Covered

**Artificial Intelligence in Context** - The evolution of AI, tracing its milestones from inception to its modern-day ubiquity. Critically examine AI's integration across various industries, emphasizing its transformative societal impact.

**Foundations of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** - Explore the relationship between AI and machine learning (ML). Participants will be introduced to the different ML methodologies, their practical applications, and the emergence of innovative AI models.

**Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)** - A deep dive into the architectures of LLMs. Learn about transformer-based models, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning mechanisms.

**Real-world Applications of Generative AI** - Study the tangible societal effects of generative AI. Explore its potential for societal transformation and the imperative of its responsible deployment.

### What I learned

Holistically describe AI's historical and societal context.

Identify the clear distinction between primary ML types and between AI and ML.

Discuss Large Language Models, particularly transformer-based architectures.

Provide perspective on the ethical, societal, and economic implications of generative AI, emphasizing responsible and inclusive deployment.
