  "What is a Machine Learning Model?": "Often dubbed as the system's 'brain', it harnesses algorithms to process data, paving the path for predictions or decisions.",
  "What is training?": "The saga of nurturing the model by processing data through the ML algorithm code.",
  "What is Testing Models?": "The act of gauging the model's mettle using new data, post-training.",
  "What is the Iteration in AI development?": "The cycle of tweaking algorithms and data, coupled with re-training, aiming to uplift model performance.",
  "What is Supervised learning?": "Like learning with a Teacher, You provide the model with data and the correct answers (labels) for each data point, much like showing a picture of a cat and telling the model it's a cat. You should use this, If you have labeled data and you want the model to learn the right answer from this data. EX, Classifying images, speech recognition, self-driving car tasks like identifying pedestrians",
  "What is Unsupervised Learning?": "A type of Model training that explores a lot of data on its own to find patterns and structures. Use this when you have unlabeled data and you want the model to find patterns or structures in the data. Ex, Generating new songs, writing code, handling unlabeled data.",
  "What is Reinforcement Learning?": "A type of model training by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards for right actions and penalties for wrong ones. Use this when you want your model to learn from its interactions and feedback, without needing labeled data.Ex, Video games, robotics, real-time decision-making in self-driving cars.",

  "Transformer Architecture (Advanced Deep Learning)": "Consisting of encoders and decoders, crucial in language translation and code generation tasks.",
  "What is the Training Process for Neural Networks?": "Involves feeding data through the network, adjusting weights based on errors, and iterating to improve accuracy. Unlike decision trees, neural networks are not easily visualizable in terms of their decision-making process because they are considered 'black box' models. You can plot the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs to understand how the model is learning.",
  "What is the ReLU activation function?": "A non-linear function that helps neural networks learn complex patterns by introducing non-linearity, allowing the model to learn more complex relationships in the data.",
  "Waht is the Sigmoid activation function": "used in the output layer to produce a probability score between 0 and 1, suitable for binary classification tasks.",
  "What is an epoch?": "one complete pass through the entire training dataset during the training of a machine learning model. It is a single iteration where the model learns from all the training data once.",
  "What is an epic?": "a large, significant project or task that is part of a larger development process, often used in agile methodologies to describe a substantial feature or goal that can be broken down into smaller tasks or user stories.",
  "What are Decision Boundary (neural networks)": "a boundary in the feature space that separates the data points into different classes based on the predictions made by the model",
  "What is Binary Classification?": "A type of classification task where the model predicts one of two possible classes or outcomes, such as spam vs. not spam in email filtering.",
  "What is Multiclass classification?": "this is a type of classification task where the model predicts one of three or more possible classes or outcomes, such as classifying images into categories like cats, dogs, and birds. (predict values from a limited, predefined set of permissbable)",
  "What us a 'Reature' in machine learning?": "Is an individual measurable property or characteristic used by the model to make predictions. Features are the input variables that the model uses to learn patterns and make decisions. (determines accuracy of model predictions)",
  "What is a 'Weight' in machine learning?": "A parameter within the model that determines the importance of a feature in making predictions. These are adjusted during the training process to minimize the error in the model's predictions. (contextual wiegh, higher weight means more importance)",
  "What is Overfitting?": "A scenario where a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and outliers, leading to poor generalization on new data. It occurs when the model is too complex relative to the amount of training data available. (eval stage doesnt perform well)"
